            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Ersen Sari, a seasoned software developer based in Melbourne. My journey in the tech world began with a solid foundation in computer systems and technologies, where I mastered algorithms and object-oriented programming. Over the years, I've built a diverse skill set ranging from frontend and backend development to full-stack and cloud services.</p>
            <p>My professional experience spans various roles and companies, starting from my early work at Aegean University in Turkey, where I developed e-learning applications. I later advanced to roles in companies like Kion IT, Bilsa Software Inc, and Tesla Control Systems, each providing opportunities to refine my skills in .Net, ASP.NET, and full-stack development.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm a part of the KMart Innovation Team in Melbourne, working as a Software Engineer where I develop prototypes and proof of concept applications. My work often involves React, TypeScript, and Node.js, focusing on integrating innovative solutions with RFID technology.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about driving technology forward, whether it's through improving system performance, integrating IoT solutions, or developing user-friendly web applications. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends and contributing to the success of digital initiatives.</p>
